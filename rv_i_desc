lui Loads a 20-bit immediate into bits 31-12 of the destination register, setting bits 11-0 to zero
auipc Forms a 32-bit offset from the 20-bit U-immediate, fills the lowest 12 bits with zeros, adds this offset to the PC, and places the result in register rd
jal Jumps to an offset formed by adding the sign-extended 20-bit immediate to the PC, and saves PC+4 to register rd
jalr Jumps to the address formed by adding the sign-extended 12-bit immediate to register rs1, and saves PC+4 to register rd
beq Compares rs1 and rs2, and if equal, branches to the PC-relative address formed by adding the sign-extended 12-bit immediate to the PC
bne Compares rs1 and rs2, and if not equal, branches to the PC-relative address formed by adding the sign-extended 12-bit immediate to the PC
blt Compares rs1 and rs2 as signed integers, and if rs1 < rs2, branches to the PC-relative address formed by adding the sign-extended 12-bit immediate to the PC
bge Compares rs1 and rs2 as signed integers, and if rs1 >= rs2, branches to the PC-relative address formed by adding the sign-extended 12-bit immediate to the PC
bltu Compares rs1 and rs2 as unsigned integers, and if rs1 < rs2, branches to the PC-relative address formed by adding the sign-extended 12-bit immediate to the PC
bgeu Compares rs1 and rs2 as unsigned integers, and if rs1 >= rs2, branches to the PC-relative address formed by adding the sign-extended 12-bit immediate to the PC
lb Loads an 8-bit value from memory, sign-extends it to 32 bits, and writes it to rd
lh Loads a 16-bit value from memory, sign-extends it to 32 bits, and writes it to rd
lw Loads a 32-bit value from memory and writes it to rd
lbu Loads an 8-bit value from memory, zero-extends it to 32 bits, and writes it to rd
lhu Loads a 16-bit value from memory, zero-extends it to 32 bits, and writes it to rd
sb Stores the lowest 8 bits from rs2 to memory at the address in rs1 plus the sign-extended 12-bit immediate
sh Stores the lowest 16 bits from rs2 to memory at the address in rs1 plus the sign-extended 12-bit immediate
sw Stores the 32 bits from rs2 to memory at the address in rs1 plus the sign-extended 12-bit immediate
addi Adds the sign-extended 12-bit immediate to rs1 and stores the result in rd
slti Compares rs1 with the sign-extended 12-bit immediate as signed integers, sets rd to 1 if rs1 < immediate, 0 otherwise
sltiu Compares rs1 with the sign-extended 12-bit immediate as unsigned integers, sets rd to 1 if rs1 < immediate, 0 otherwise
xori Performs bitwise XOR on rs1 and the sign-extended 12-bit immediate, stores the result in rd
ori Performs bitwise OR on rs1 and the sign-extended 12-bit immediate, stores the result in rd
andi Performs bitwise AND on rs1 and the sign-extended 12-bit immediate, stores the result in rd
add Adds rs1 and rs2, stores the result in rd
sub Subtracts rs2 from rs1, stores the result in rd
sll Shifts rs1 left by the amount specified in the lower 5 bits of rs2, stores the result in rd
slt Compares rs1 and rs2 as signed integers, sets rd to 1 if rs1 < rs2, 0 otherwise
sltu Compares rs1 and rs2 as unsigned integers, sets rd to 1 if rs1 < rs2, 0 otherwise
xor Performs bitwise XOR on rs1 and rs2, stores the result in rd
srl Shifts rs1 right by the amount specified in the lower 5 bits of rs2, filling with zeros, stores the result in rd
sra Shifts rs1 right by the amount specified in the lower 5 bits of rs2, filling with the sign bit, stores the result in rd
or Performs bitwise OR on rs1 and rs2, stores the result in rd
and Performs bitwise AND on rs1 and rs2, stores the result in rd
fence Enforces ordering between memory operations and I/O from different RISC-V harts
