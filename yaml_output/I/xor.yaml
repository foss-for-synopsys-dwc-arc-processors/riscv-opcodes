xor:
  long_name: Exclusive OR two values
  description: |
      Performs bitwise XOR between rs1 and rs2, writing the result to rd.
    XOR is a versatile operation used in various contexts. In cryptography, it's fundamental
    to many encryption algorithms and in generating pseudo-random sequences. XOR is
    used for simple checksums and hash functions, and for toggling bits based on a
    mask. It's also useful in certain arithmetic operations, like swapping values
    without a temporary variable or detecting changes between two values. In graphics,
    XOR can be used for simple drawing operations that can be easily undone.
