sra:
  long_name: Shift Right Arithmetic
  description: |
      Shifts rs1 right by the amount specified in the lower 5 (RV32) or 6
    (RV64) bits of rs2, sign-extending (copying the most significant bit). Writes
    the result to rd. Arithmetic right shifts are equivalent to division by powers
    of 2 for signed integers, rounding towards negative infinity. SRA is essential
    in implementing efficient signed division by constants and in certain signal processing
    operations. It's also used in various algorithms where the
