fence.tso:
  long_name: Total Store Ordering fence
  description: Provides Total Store Ordering (TSO) memory consistency. It ensures
    that all stores before the FENCE.TSO instruction are globally visible before any
    loads after the instruction are performed. This instruction is a lighter-weight
    version of the general FENCE instruction, specifically designed for architectures
    that support TSO memory models. FENCE.TSO is particularly useful in implementing
    synchronization primitives and in porting code from architectures with stronger
    memory models (like x86) to RISC-V. It provides a balance between the strict ordering
    of FENCE and the relaxed ordering of normal memory operations, allowing for potential
    performance optimizations while still ensuring necessary memory consistency in
    concurrent programs.
