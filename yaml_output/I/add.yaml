add:
  long_name: Add two values
  description: Adds rs1 and rs2, writing the result to rd. This basic arithmetic operation
    is fundamental in almost all computational tasks. It's used in address calculations,
    loop counters, array indexing, and general arithmetic operations in high-level
    languages. In more complex mathematical operations, ADD forms the basis for multi-word
    arithmetic and can be used to implement higher-precision calculations. It's also
    used in pointer arithmetic and in implementing certain algorithms like checksums.
