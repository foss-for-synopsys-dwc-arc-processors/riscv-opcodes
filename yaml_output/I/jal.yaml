  long_name: Jump and Link to target address, storing return address
  description: |
      "Performs an unconditional jump to a PC-relative offset and saves the\
    \ address of the next instruction (PC+4) in the destination register (usually\
    \ x1/ra). The offset is encoded in the immediate field, allowing jumps of up to\
    \ \xB11 MiB. This instruction is primarily used for procedure calls, where the\
    \ return address needs to be saved. The large jump range makes it suitable for\
    \ most function calls within a program. If the rd field is zero, no return address\
    \ is saved, allowing JAL to be used for unconditional branches as well."
