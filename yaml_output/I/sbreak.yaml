      '(Superseded by EBREAK) This instruction was used in earlier versions
    of the RISC-V specification but has been replaced by EBREAK. It was originally
    intended to trigger a breakpoint exception, similar to the current EBREAK instruction.
    For compatibility reasons, some implementations may still recognize SBREAK, treating
    it identically to EBREAK. However, new code should use EBREAK instead. The functionality
    and use cases are the same as described for EBREAK: primarily for debugging purposes,
    allowing programmers to set breakpoints in their code for step-by-step execution
    and inspection in a debug environment.'
