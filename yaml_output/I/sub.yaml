sub:
  long_name: Subtract one value from another
  description: |
      Subtracts rs2 from rs1, writing the result to rd. Subtraction is essential
    in many computational tasks, including address offset calculations, implementing
    decremental loops, and general arithmetic operations. SUB is often used in comparison
    operations (by subtracting and then checking the sign of the result) and in implementing
    more complex mathematical functions. In pointer arithmetic, it's used to calculate
    the distance between two pointers. SUB is also key in implementing two's complement
    negation (by subtracting from zero).
