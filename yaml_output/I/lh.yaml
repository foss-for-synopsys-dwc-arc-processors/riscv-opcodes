lh:
  long_name: Load signed Halfword from memory
  description: |
      Loads a 16-bit value from memory, sign-extends it to XLEN bits, and
    writes it to rd. The effective address is obtained by adding register rs1 to the
    sign-extended 12-bit offset. This instruction is used for accessing 16-bit (halfword)
    data types, such as short integers in C. The sign-extension ensures that signed
    16-bit values are correctly interpreted in 32-bit or 64-bit contexts. LH is commonly
    used in audio processing (for 16-bit samples), in graphics (for certain color
    depths), and in working with communication protocols that use 16-bit data units.
