  long_name: Branch if Equal
  description: |
      "Compares two registers (rs1 and rs2) and conditionally branches if\
    \ they are equal. If the condition is true, the program counter is updated to\
    \ PC + immediate, where the immediate is a signed 13-bit offset counting in 2-byte\
    \ units. This allows for branches within a \xB14 KiB range. BEQ is fundamental\
    \ for implementing conditional statements and loops in high-level languages. It's\
    \ often used in combination with other branch instructions to create more complex\
    \ conditions. The zero-overhead loop feature in some RISC-V implementations can\
    \ use this instruction for loop termination checks."
