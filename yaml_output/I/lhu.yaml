lhu:
  long_name: Load unsigned Halfword from memory
  description: |
      Loads a 16-bit value from memory, zero-extends it to XLEN bits, and
    writes it to rd. The effective address is obtained by adding register rs1 to the
    sign-extended 12-bit offset. This instruction is used for loading unsigned halfword
    (16-bit) values, ensuring that the upper bits are always zero. It's commonly used
    when working with unsigned short types in C, or in graphics and audio processing
    where 16-bit unsigned values are common (e.g., certain color or sample formats).
    LHU is also useful in network protocols and file formats that use 16-bit unsigned
    fields.
