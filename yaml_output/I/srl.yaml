srl:
  long_name: Shift Right Logical
  description: Shifts rs1 right by the amount specified in the lower 5 (RV32) or 6
    (RV64) bits of rs2, filling with zeros. Writes the result to rd. Right logical
    shifts are equivalent to division by powers of 2 for unsigned integers, making
    SRL useful for efficient division by constants. It's crucial in various bit manipulation
    techniques, such as extracting the least significant bits of a value. SRL is often
    used in implementing unsigned integer division algorithms, in certain cryptographic
    operations, and in graphics processing for color manipulation.
