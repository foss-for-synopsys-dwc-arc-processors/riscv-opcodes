  long_name: Load Upper Immediate
  description: |
      Loads a 20-bit immediate value into the upper 20 bits of the destination
    register, setting the lower 12 bits to zero. This instruction is commonly used
    in conjunction with an ADDI instruction to create 32-bit constants. It's particularly
    useful for loading large constants or addresses into registers, as it allows for
    efficient encoding of 32-bit values using two instructions. The immediate value
    is sign-extended and shifted left by 12 bits before being placed in the destination
    register, which means it can represent multiples of 4096 (2^12).
