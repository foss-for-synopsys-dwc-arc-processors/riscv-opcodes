bge:
  long_name: Branch if Greater than or Equal (Signed)
  description: Compares two registers (rs1 and rs2) as signed integers and conditionally
    branches if rs1 is greater than or equal to rs2. If the condition is true, the
    program counter is updated to PC + immediate, where the immediate is a signed
    13-bit offset counting in 2-byte units. This instruction complements BLT and is
    used in similar contexts for signed integer comparisons. It's particularly useful
    in implementing the upper bound checks in loops and in range-checking operations.
    BGE can be used to implement less-than-or-equal comparisons by swapping the order
    of the operands.
