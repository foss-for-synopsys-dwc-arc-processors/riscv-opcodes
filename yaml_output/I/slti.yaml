slti:
  long_name: Set if Less Than Immediate (Signed)
  description: |
      Compares rs1 with the sign-extended immediate as signed integers. Sets
    rd to 1 if rs1 < imm, 0 otherwise. This instruction is used for signed comparisons
    with constants, which is useful in implementing conditional statements and loops
    in high-level languages. It's particularly efficient for range checks and for
    implementing min/max functions with compile-time known bounds. SLTI can be used
    to create bitmasks based on the sign of a value, which is useful in certain bit
    manipulation techniques.
