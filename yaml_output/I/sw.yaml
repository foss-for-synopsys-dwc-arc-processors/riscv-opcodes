sw:
  long_name: Store Word to memory
  description: Stores the lowest 32 bits from rs2 to memory. The effective address
    is obtained by adding register rs1 to the sign-extended 12-bit offset. This is
    the primary instruction for storing 32-bit values to memory, including integers,
    single-precision floating-point values (when used by the F extension), and memory
    addresses in RV32. In RV64, it's used for storing the lower half of 64-bit values
    and for compatibility with 32-bit data. SW is fundamental in most memory write
    operations, including array updates, structure field modifications, and storing
    computed results or updated global variables.
