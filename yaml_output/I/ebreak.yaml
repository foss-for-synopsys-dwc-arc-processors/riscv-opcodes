ebreak:
  long_name: Environment break
  description: |
      Triggers a breakpoint exception, transferring control to a debug environment.
    This instruction is primarily used for debugging purposes, allowing programmers
    to set breakpoints in their code for step-by-step execution and inspection. When
    an EBREAK is encountered during normal execution, it causes the processor to enter
    debug mode, where the program's state can be examined and modified. This is crucial
    for identifying and fixing bugs, especially in embedded systems or operating system
    development where traditional software debuggers might not be available. EBREAK
    is also sometimes used in implementing system calls or other privilege-level transitions
    in some RISC-V systems.
