  long_name: Branch if Not Equal
  description: |
      "Compares two registers (rs1 and rs2) and conditionally branches if\
    \ they are not equal. If the condition is true, the program counter is updated\
    \ to PC + immediate, where the immediate is a signed 13-bit offset counting in\
    \ 2-byte units. This allows for branches within a \xB14 KiB range. BNE is widely\
    \ used in implementing loops, especially for loop continuation conditions. It's\
    \ also used in conditional statements and in implementing more complex control\
    \ flow structures. In combination with BEQ, it forms the basis for most conditional\
    \ branching in RISC-V assembly."
