andi:
  long_name: AND Immediate
  description: Performs bitwise AND between rs1 and the sign-extended 12-bit immediate,
    writing the result to rd. This instruction is crucial for masking operations,
    where specific bits need to be isolated or cleared. It's commonly used in bit
    manipulation, for example, to clear the upper bits of a value or to extract specific
    bitfields. ANDI is also key in implementing bitwise flags and in certain optimizations
    where only the lower bits of a value are significant. In boolean algebra, it's
    used for logical AND operations with constants.
