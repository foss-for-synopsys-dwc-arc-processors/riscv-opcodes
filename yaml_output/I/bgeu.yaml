bgeu:
  long_name: Branch if Greater than or Equal (Unsigned)
  description: Compares two registers (rs1 and rs2) as unsigned integers and conditionally
    branches if rs1 is greater than or equal to rs2. If the condition is true, the
    program counter is updated to PC + immediate, where the immediate is a signed
    13-bit offset counting in 2-byte units. This instruction complements BLTU and
    is used for similar unsigned comparison operations. It's particularly useful for
    implementing upper bound checks in loops with unsigned counters, and in range-checking
    operations involving memory addresses or other unsigned values. BGEU can be used
    to implement less-than-or-equal comparisons for unsigned integers by swapping
    the order of the operands.
