  description: '(Superseded by ECALL) This instruction was used in earlier versions
    of the RISC-V specification but has been replaced by ECALL. It was originally
    intended to generate a system call exception, similar to the current ECALL instruction.
    For compatibility reasons, some implementations may still recognize SCALL, treating
    it identically to ECALL. However, new code should use ECALL instead. The functionality
    and use cases are the same as described for ECALL: primarily used for making requests
    to the execution environment (typically an operating system), implementing system
    calls, and facilitating transitions between privilege levels in RISC-V systems.'
