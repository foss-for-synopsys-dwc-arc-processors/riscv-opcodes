sltu:
  long_name: Set if Less Than (Unsigned)
  description: |
      Compares rs1 and rs2 as unsigned integers. Sets rd to 1 if rs1 < rs2,
    0 otherwise. SLTU is essential for unsigned comparisons, often used with memory
    addresses, array indices, and other naturally unsigned values. It's particularly
    useful in bounds checking for arrays, in implementing unsigned arithmetic operations,
    and in certain low-level memory management tasks. SLTU can be more efficient than
    SLT for certain types of comparisons, especially when dealing with memory addresses
    or when the values are known to be non-negative.
