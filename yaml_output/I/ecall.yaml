ecall:
  long_name: Environment call
  description: |
      Generates an environment call exception, used to make a request to
    the execution environment (typically an operating system). This instruction is
    fundamental in implementing system calls, which are the primary mechanism for
    user-level programs to request services from the operating system. When an ECALL
    is executed, control is transferred to the operating system or execution environment,
    which then determines the nature of the request based on values in specific registers.
    ECALL is crucial in implementing features like file I/O, process management, and
    other operating system services. In bare-metal environments, it can be used to
    implement custom exception handling or to switch between different modes of operation.
