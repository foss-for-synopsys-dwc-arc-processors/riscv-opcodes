sh:
  long_name: Store Halfword to memory
  description: |
      Stores the lowest 16 bits from rs2 to memory. The effective address
    is obtained by adding register rs1 to the sign-extended 12-bit offset. This instruction
    is used for writing 16-bit (halfword) values to memory. It's commonly employed
    when working with short integer types, in audio processing for storing 16-bit
    samples, in graphics for certain color depth operations, and in various protocols
    and file formats that use 16-bit data units. SH is also useful in embedded systems
    where memory might be arranged in 16-bit words.
