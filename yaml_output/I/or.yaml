or:
  long_name: OR two values
  description: |
      Performs bitwise OR between rs1 and rs2, writing the result to rd.
    This instruction is essential in bitwise operations and is widely used in various
    programming tasks. OR is primarily used for setting specific bits in a register
    while leaving others unchanged. It's commonly employed in flag manipulation, for
    example, in setting option bits in configuration words or status registers. In
    boolean algebra implementations, OR is used for logical OR operations. It's also
    useful in creating bitmasks, in certain bitfield manipulation techniques, and
    in implementing simple data merging operations. In graphics programming, OR can
    be used for combining multiple layers or applying certain effects.
