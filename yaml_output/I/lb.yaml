lb:
  long_name: Load signed Byte from memory
  description: Loads an 8-bit value from memory, sign-extends it to XLEN bits (32
    bits in RV32, 64 bits in RV64), and writes it to rd. The effective address is
    obtained by adding register rs1 to the sign-extended 12-bit offset. This instruction
    is crucial for accessing individual bytes in memory, such as when working with
    character data or packed data structures. The sign-extension allows for proper
    handling of signed 8-bit values in larger integer contexts. LB is often used in
    string processing, parsing binary data, and accessing byte-addressable devices.
