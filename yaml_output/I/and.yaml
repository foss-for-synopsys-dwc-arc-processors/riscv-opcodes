  long_name: AND two values
  description: Performs bitwise AND between rs1 and rs2, writing the result to rd.
    This instruction is fundamental in bitwise operations and is extensively used
    in various low-level programming tasks. It's crucial for masking operations, where
    specific bits need to be isolated or cleared while leaving others unchanged. AND
    is commonly used in flag manipulation, for extracting specific bitfields from
    larger words, and in implementing logical operations in boolean algebra. In embedded
    systems, it's often used for clearing specific bits in control registers. AND
    is also key in certain optimization techniques where only specific bits of a value
    are significant, and in implementing bitwise algorithms in cryptography and hash
    functions.
