  long_name: Store Byte to memory
  description: Stores the lowest 8 bits from rs2 to memory. The effective address
    is obtained by adding register rs1 to the sign-extended 12-bit offset. This instruction
    is essential for writing individual bytes to memory, which is crucial in many
    low-level operations. It's commonly used in string manipulation, when writing
    to byte-addressable devices, in network protocol implementations for setting individual
    flag bits, and in general when working with packed data structures or binary file
    formats.
