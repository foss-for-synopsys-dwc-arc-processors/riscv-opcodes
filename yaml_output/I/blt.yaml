blt:
  long_name: Branch if Less Than (Signed)
  description: Compares two registers (rs1 and rs2) as signed integers and conditionally
    branches if rs1 is less than rs2. If the condition is true, the program counter
    is updated to PC + immediate, where the immediate is a signed 13-bit offset counting
    in 2-byte units. This instruction is crucial for implementing signed comparisons
    in loops and conditional statements. It's often used in sorting algorithms, binary
    searches, and other comparison-based operations. BLT can be combined with BGE
    to create equality comparisons for signed integers.
