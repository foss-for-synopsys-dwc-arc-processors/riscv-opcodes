jalr:
  long_name: Jump and Link to computed target, storing return address
  description: |
      Jumps to an address computed from a base register (rs1) and a 12-bit
    immediate offset, saving the address of the next instruction (PC+4) in the destination
    register (usually x1/ra). This instruction is more flexible than JAL as it allows
    for computed jumps and can be used for returns, indirect calls, and implementing
    switch statements. The computed target address is the sum of rs1 and the sign-extended
    12-bit immediate, with the least significant bit set to zero. This instruction
    is crucial for implementing function returns and for calling functions through
    function pointers.
