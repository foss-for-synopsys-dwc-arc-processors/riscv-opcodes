bltu:
  long_name: Branch if Less Than (Unsigned)
  description: |
      Compares two registers (rs1 and rs2) as unsigned integers and conditionally
    branches if rs1 is less than rs2. If the condition is true, the program counter
    is updated to PC + immediate, where the immediate is a signed 13-bit offset counting
    in 2-byte units. BLTU is essential for unsigned comparisons, which are often used
    with memory addresses, array indices, and other naturally unsigned values. It's
    particularly useful in bounds checking for arrays and in implementing unsigned
    arithmetic operations. BLTU can be more efficient than BLT for certain types of
    comparisons, especially when dealing with memory addresses.
