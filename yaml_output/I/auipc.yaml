  long_name: Add Upper Immediate to PC
  description: "Adds a 20-bit immediate value (shifted left by 12 bits) to the current\
    \ PC (Program Counter), storing the full 32-bit result in the destination register.\
    \ This instruction is particularly useful for PC-relative addressing, especially\
    \ when used in conjunction with JALR for implementing large PC-relative offsets.\
    \ It allows for efficient encoding of 32-bit PC-relative addresses, which is crucial\
    \ for position-independent code. The immediate value is sign-extended and shifted\
    \ left by 12 bits before being added to the PC, allowing for a range of \xB12\
    \ GiB around the current PC."
