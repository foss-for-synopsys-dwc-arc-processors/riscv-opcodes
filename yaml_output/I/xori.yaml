xori:
  long_name: Exclusive OR Immediate
  description: Performs bitwise XOR between rs1 and the sign-extended 12-bit immediate,
    writing the result to rd. This instruction is versatile in bitwise operations.
    It's commonly used for toggling specific bits, implementing simple hash functions,
    and in certain encryption algorithms. XORI with an immediate of -1 (all ones)
    performs a bitwise NOT operation, which is useful for inverting bits or implementing
    logical negation. In boolean algebra implementations, XORI is crucial for exclusive-or
    operations.
